Here we have a fork on the classic Rock Paper Scissors called PVP short for Paper Vomit Plastic!

Instead of Rock, we have a Paper Bag!
Instead of Paper, we have Vomit!
And Instead of Scissors, we have a Plastic Bag!

Paper Bag wins against Plastic Bag because it's eco-friendly!
But Loses against Vomit, for obvious reasons!! Which in turn loses against Plastic Bag

Inspiration comes from Youtuber Sheena Melwani and her husband TRID !
Here's a link to their video :
